# Architecture

AgentRoom is a WhatsApp/Slack-style group chat where LLM command-line tools are
**named, visible participants**. One human message fans out to every active agent in
the room; each agent replies independently as its own chat participant.

This document explains the moving parts, the data-flow, the `agent_runs` queue
contract, the adapter model, the trust boundaries, and every environment variable.
For operations see [OBSERVABILITY.md](OBSERVABILITY.md); for setup see
[SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md).

## Components

| Component | Tech | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Web** (`apps/web`) | Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind | Chat UI + API route handlers; the only writer of `messages`/`agent_runs` |
| **Supabase** | Postgres + Auth + Realtime + Storage | Data, auth, row-level security, realtime broadcast, file storage; **the work queue is the `agent_runs` table** |
| **Bridge** (`bridge`) | Node.js + TypeScript (run via tsx) | Polls the queue, builds the context packet, runs agent CLIs as subprocesses, writes replies back |
| **Shared** (`packages/shared`) | TypeScript (ESM) | Types + helpers shared by web + bridge (`ContextPacketV1`, `AgentEvent`, logger, redaction, error tracking) |
| **Agent CLIs** | external binaries | Claude Code, Codex CLI, and a mock adapter |

  Browser -- "auth + realtime subscribe" --> Supabase
  Browser -- "POST message" --> RH
  RH -- "insert message + one agent_runs row\nper active unmuted agent (status=queued)" --> PG
  PG -- "queued runs" --> Bridge
  Bridge -- "claim → running → completed/failed/cancelled\n+ insert agent reply into messages" --> PG
  Bridge -- "ContextPacketV1 via stdin / control" --> CLIs
  CLIs -- "AgentEvent stream via stdout" --> Bridge
  PG -- "broadcast new rows" --> RT
  RT -- "live updates" --> Browser
```

**Write-path rule (invariant):** Browser → Next.js route handler → Supabase rows →
Bridge. **The browser never writes `agent_runs` or `messages` directly** — RLS
enforces this. The browser only reads (subject to membership) and calls authenticated
route handlers for mutations.

## The `agent_runs` queue contract

`agent_runs` *is* the work queue (no Redis). The lifecycle:

```
queued → claimed → running → (completed | failed | cancelled)
```

- A user message POST inserts one `agent_runs` row (`status='queued'`) per active,
  unmuted, reply-enabled agent (or only mentioned agents for `@mentions`).
- The bridge **atomically claims** a run with a conditional update
  (`update(status='claimed').eq('status','queued')`) so only one worker wins — no
  double-processing.
- It then moves `claimed → running`, builds the context packet, runs the adapter,
  and on success inserts the agent reply into `messages` and marks the run
  `completed`. Any error → `failed` (with a redacted `error_message`); a user cancel →
  `cancelled`.
- **Heartbeats:** running runs write `heartbeat_at` periodically. A crashed worker
  leaves a stale run; **stale-run recovery** (on startup + a periodic sweep) marks
  runs with a stale/`null` heartbeat `failed`. Recovered runs are **not auto-retried**
  (see [OBSERVABILITY.md](OBSERVABILITY.md#5--reliability--the-run-state-machine)).
- Loop guards (`round_index`, hop limits) bound agent-to-agent and `/discuss`
  fan-out so runs can't multiply unbounded — see
  [Agent-to-agent interaction](#agent-to-agent-interaction-phase-10).

## The adapter model

Adapters live in `bridge/src/adapters/` and are selected by `adapter_type` in
`registry.ts`. Each implements `AgentAdapter.run(packet, signal)` and **yields the
`AgentEvent` union** (`final_response`, `visible_message`, `error`,
`tool_call_requested`, `partial_content`, `memory_op` (Phase 9), and
`handoff_requested` (Phase 10)). Adapters **never write to Supabase
directly** — the run worker (`workers/run-worker.ts`) owns all persistence.

`SubprocessAdapter` is the base for CLI-backed agents: it resolves an allowlisted
binary, spawns it with `shell:false` + an argv array, delivers the `ContextPacketV1`
(and the agent's `system_prompt`) via **stdin**, parses stdout lines into events,
enforces a timeout + output cap, and force-kills the process tree on
abort/timeout/cancel. Adding an adapter is documented in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-agent-adapter-extensibility).

## Agent-to-agent interaction (Phase 10)

Agents are first-class peers: each run's `ContextPacketV1.roster` lists the **other**
active room agents (`name`, `slug`, and a `capabilities` blurb), rendered as
reference DATA so an agent can address a peer deliberately — by `@mention` or by a
hand-off. The roster excludes the acting agent and muted/inactive members.

**Hand-off protocol (agent-emitted).** An agent emits a `handoff_requested` event by
printing a control envelope to stdout (`{ "type":"handoff_requested", "to_agent_slug",
"reason", "payload"? }`); the subprocess adapter parses it into the `AgentEvent`
(alongside `final_response`/`memory_op`). The run worker defers it until the agent's
reply is inserted (that message becomes the peer run's trigger), then
`agents/handoff.ts` resolves the slug to a room agent and creates a **targeted**
`agent_runs` row — never the agent itself — under the full loop guards **and cycle
detection** below. At most `MAX_HANDOFFS_PER_RUN` are honored per run.

**User `/handoff` (a convenience, not the agent engine).** `/handoff @agent <task>`
typed by a user is rewritten client-side to a targeted `@agent <task>` message and
goes through the normal messages route + mention routing. It is **round/hop bounded**
like any mention but does **not** run the agent-chain cycle detection (a human turn
is not a loop risk; the deliberation chain it may start is still round-capped).
`/agents` lists the roster + active runs.

**Loop-guard math (agent hand-off chains provably terminate).** An agent-emitted
hand-off is allowed only when **all** hold; otherwise it's blocked (and a cap/cycle
posts a visible *"Deliberation ended …"* system message):

- `rooms.allow_agent_to_agent` is true.
- **Round cap:** `round_index + 1 < rooms.max_agent_rounds` (default 3).
- **Hop cap:** `deliberation_depth + 1 ≤ rooms.max_agent_hops` (default 6).
- **No cycle:** the target has **not** already appeared in this hand-off chain. Every
  run in a chain shares a `deliberation_root_id`; cycle detection collects the root
  run's agent plus all descendants and rejects a hand-off to any agent already
  present (so `A→B→A`, `A→B→C→B`, etc. are stopped).

Because `deliberation_depth` strictly increases per hand-off and is bounded by
`max_agent_hops` — and a repeat participant is rejected — every chain terminates.
The `/discuss` phase machine (`individual → critique → consensus`) and the
`tag_turns` mention-follow-up path are bounded the same way by `max_agent_rounds`.

## Slash commands & RBAC (Phase 11)

A single **command registry** (`packages/shared/src/commands.ts`,
`COMMAND_REGISTRY`) is the source of truth for every in-product slash command:
`{ name, description, argsSpec, minRole, surface }`. Both the message parser
(`apps/web/lib/slash-commands.ts`, via `extractCommand`) and the API read from it,
so a command's existence and role gating live in one place. The v1 set:
`/help`, `/commands`, `/discuss`, `/remember`, `/recall`, `/handoff`, `/agents`,
`/pin`, `/reset`.

**RBAC.** Roles are the per-room `MemberRole` (`owner > admin > member`). `roleAllows`
ranks them; `allowedCommands`/`formatHelp` drive `/help`, which lists **exactly** the
caller's permitted commands. Member-level commands need only room membership;
admin-only commands (currently `/reset`) are enforced **server-side** — the
`/reset` route calls `requireRoomAdmin`, so a `member` is rejected with 403 even if the
UI did not hide the command. The parser never bypasses RLS or the tool-approval flow;
unknown/over-privileged commands get a friendly rejection rather than being sent.

**`/reset`** clears a room's *rolling agent context* without deleting data: it stamps
`rooms.context_reset_at`, and the bridge context builder only includes messages created
at/after that watermark. The transcript stays intact and the action is reversible.

## User-created agents (Phase 11)

Beyond adding seeded agents to a room, admins can author new agents:
`POST /api/agents` (create + attach to a room), `PATCH/DELETE /api/agents/[agentId]`
(edit / disable). **RBAC:** create requires `requireRoomAdmin` on the target room;
edit/disable require being the agent's creator (`created_by_user_id = auth.uid()`).
Seeded agents (`created_by_user_id IS NULL`) are not editable. `DELETE` disables
(`is_active = false`) rather than hard-deleting, so it is reversible.

**Security coupling (hard invariant).** A user-set `system_prompt` is fully
attacker-controlled. It is persisted as data and reaches a CLI **only via stdin, never
argv** — `buildArgs` is static and `buildStdin` carries the persona (see
`subprocess-security.test.ts`). `adapter_type` is allowlisted to implemented adapters
(an unknown type cannot reach the run worker), and `tool_permissions` is forced empty:
a user-created agent gets **no** tool auto-approvals — every tool still flows through
the approval gate.

## Trust boundaries

- **Browser ↔ web**: untrusted client. Auth (Supabase) + RLS + per-route
  authorization + Origin/CSRF checks + rate limiting + input validation (zod).
- **Web/bridge ↔ Supabase**: the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is **server-only** and
  never reaches the browser bundle. The browser uses the publishable key + RLS.
- **Bridge ↔ agent CLIs**: the bridge runs CLIs **on its host**. This is the sharpest
  boundary — see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for the subprocess sandbox and the
  "run only where you trust the participants" rule. The default Docker bridge image
  ships the mock adapter only.
- **Bridge ↔ third parties**: optional OpenAI image-text egress, off by default.

## Environment variables

The **core connection variables** (Supabase URL + keys) are validated at boot with
zod — a missing/invalid value fails fast and names itself. The remaining variables are
read with safe in-code defaults (shown below). Keep `.env.example` files
authoritative. **Never commit real secrets.**

### Web (`apps/web/.env.local`)

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | yes | — | Supabase URL (baked into the browser bundle at build time; must be browser-reachable) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | yes | — | Publishable/anon key for the browser client. **Never use the deprecated `…_ANON_KEY` name** |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | yes | — | **Server-only** service-role key (route handlers). Never exposed to the browser |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | no | — (no runtime fallback) | App origin added to the CSRF/Origin allowlist. Unset ⇒ the app origin is simply not in the allowlist, so set it outside local dev. (The Docker build sets it as a build arg.) |
| `EXTRA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | no | — | Comma-separated extra origins allowed for mutating requests (reverse proxies) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | `debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error` |

### Bridge (`bridge/.env`)

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | yes | — | Supabase URL the bridge connects to |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | yes | — | Server-only service-role key (the bridge writes runs/messages) |
| `BRIDGE_WORKER_ID` | no | `bridge-local-1` | Identifies this worker in logs/claims |
| `BRIDGE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | no | `2000` | Queue poll interval |

| `BRIDGE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` | no | `5000` | Heartbeat write interval for active runs |
| `BRIDGE_STALE_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | `60000` | A run with an older/`null` heartbeat is recovered as `failed` |
| `BRIDGE_HEALTH_PORT` | no | `9090` | Liveness/metrics HTTP port (`/healthz`, `/metrics`); `0` disables. Bind internal-only |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | Log level |

| `CLAUDE_BIN` / `CODEX_BIN` | no | command name on `PATH` | Path/command for the agent CLIs the bridge spawns |
| `ENABLE_IMAGE_TEXT_EXTRACTION` | no | `false` | Enable OpenAI image-text egress (**off by default**) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | conditional | — | Required only if image-text extraction is enabled |
| `OPENAI_VISION_MODEL` | no | `gpt-4.1-mini` | Vision model for extraction |
| `BRIDGE_CHILD_ENV_ALLOW` | no | — | Comma-separated extra env names forwarded to child CLIs. Secrets (`SUPABASE_*`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`, `BRIDGE_*`) are **never** forwarded |
